"""Decides where a parsed supplier invoice goes and performs the uploads.

InvoiceM8 is an ACCOUNTS PAYABLE tool: it files invoices the business has
RECEIVED from its suppliers against the right job. The "customer" tables and
columns are named from an early misreading of that and are kept for schema
stability - everything user-facing calls them suppliers.

Rules (from the spec):
  * Match extracted customer name against the local DB (name + aliases).
  * Unknown customer -> added automatically, flagged as unreviewed (NEW in
    the Customers tab) and routed straight away. Defaults: Service system ON,
    Accounting system OFF, PDF only. An invoice with no readable customer name
    is queued in ``pending_invoices`` instead, since there is nothing to file
    it under.
  * Known customer -> for each enabled toggle, call the matching provider:
      - servicem8_enabled  -> the selected Service system
      - accounting_enabled -> the selected Accounting system
  * Duplicate guard: a document (by file hash, or customer+ref+type) is never
    uploaded to the same platform twice - see processed_documents.
  * Credit notes (doc_type == "credit") are routed as credits/vendor-credits
    where the provider supports it.
Every attempt is written to activity_log or error_log.
