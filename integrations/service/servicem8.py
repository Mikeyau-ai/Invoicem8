"""ServiceM8 provider - attaches invoices to jobs via the REST API.

Auth: a ServiceM8 "Private Application" API key, sent in the ``X-API-Key``
header (ServiceM8's documented method for private apps - it is NOT HTTP Basic
auth; sending Basic auth makes ServiceM8 reply "Invalid username or password").

Flow:
  1. Look up the job by the extracted job number (``generated_job_id`` /
     ``job_number`` field on the Job object).
  2. Create an Attachment record linked to that job UUID and upload the file
     bytes to the ``.file`` sub-resource.
