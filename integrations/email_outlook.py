"""Mailbox access with interchangeable backends.

* ``com``   - CLASSIC Outlook desktop via pywin32. No credentials, but needs a
              paid Microsoft 365 subscription and does not work with the new
              Outlook for Windows (no COM interface).
* ``graph`` - Microsoft Graph REST API with device-code OAuth2. The route for
              the new Outlook and outlook.com accounts.
* ``imap``  - generic IMAP (see :mod:`integrations.email_imap`) for Gmail,
              Fastmail and most providers that still accept an app password.

Every backend returns a list of :class:`EmailMessage`; attachments are written
to the attachment cache and referenced by path.

Two arguments shape how much work a fetch does:

``seen_ids``
    Message ids already recorded in ``processed_emails``. A backend must skip
    these *before* downloading their attachments - otherwise an invoice sitting
    in the inbox is re-downloaded on every poll for as long as it stays inside
    the lookback window.
``headers_only``
    Identify matching messages but do not download or write attachment bytes.
    Used by the Settings "Test mailbox" button, which only needs a count.
